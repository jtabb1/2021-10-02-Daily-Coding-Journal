    <p> 
      Today I went to the gym, ate, took a nap, shopped online 
      and ordered necessary things, spoke to a family member, 
      and planned out tonight and tomorrow.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Among other things I want to do tonight I want to do some 
      coding in particular learn how to do authentication and 
      authorization.
